    "To-do lists are great for keeping track of what you need to do. But they rarely tell you what to do when.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take my to-do list for example. Here are some of my weekly tasks this semester:\n",
    "\n",
    "![todolist.png](todolist.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each task has a deadline and an estimation of how long it will take to complete it. Notice that one of these tasks has a subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "![subtask.png](subtask.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I prefer to print out the worksheet, fill it out, and then upload it as a pdf. In order to do my 577 homework assignment, then, I need to *first* print out the worksheet. We could say that doing my 577 homework depends on printing out the homework sheet. In optimization speak, my 577 homework task has a dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I can't do my homework all day every day, so I have to choose which tasks I do each day carefully. If I spend my time Monday working on something that isn't due until later in the week, I could miss the deadline for another assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This project outlines a model that will tell me which tasks I should do on each day of the week given each task's dependencies, expected duration, deadline, and the amount of time I have to do homework each day.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **Mathematical Model section**, I turn this problem into equations. More specifically, I explain how my to-do list problem can be formulated as a Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP) and outline the model's decision variables, constraints, and objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these equations, I can have a computer solve this problem for me. In the **Code section**, I show what my model can look like in the JuMP and Julia languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our output from the computer solver, I then explain what these results mean and the limitations of my model in the **Results and Discussion section** (turns out planning out your week is more complicated than I thought!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in the **Conclusion section** I explain next steps for turning my daily to-do lists into one to-do list for the entire week. (Spoiler alert: more models!)"

    "\n",
    "My to-do list scenario falls under the category of the generalized assignment problem (GAP). In a generalized assignment problem, the goal is to match one set of items to another, given certain constraints. In this problem, we want to match tasks to days of the week. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generalized Assignment Problems are a kind of integer program because we are forcing our assignments to have integer values. For example, in this program, there isn't a range of values between days of the week: it's either Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday and so on.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",

    "* I only have a certain amount of time available each day to work on tasks.\n",
    "* I can only do one task at a time.\n",
    "* I am doing each task in one and only one sitting.\n",
    "* There is no travel time or break time needed between tasks.\n",
    "* Some, but not all, tasks depend on other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before we jump into the decision variables, constraints, and objective, let's get some notation out of the way:**\n",
    "* Let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of tasks to complete.\n",
    "* Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of days for the tasks to be completed in.\n",
    "* Let $\\mathcal{P}$ be the set of tasks that are the ancestors of a given task. In other words, $\\mathcal{P}_j$ contains the tasks that j depends on.\n",
    "* Let $\\text{durations}_i$ be the set of task durations for a task i.\n",
    "* Let $\\text{available_work_time}$ be the set of times (in minutes) that I can work each day in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The next two constraints are a bit more complicated because they include boolean logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deadline constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each task must be completed before its deadline:\n",
    "    We can phrase this constraint as \"if $j > deadline_i$, then $d_{ij} = 0$\". Using rules from logical constraints, we can write the constraint as the formula:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    for $i \\in \\mathcal{T}$ and $j \\in \\mathcal{D}$, $j - deadlines_i \\le M(1 - d_{ij})$, where $M$ is $|\\mathcal{D}|$ - 1\n",

    "    \n",
    "When $d_{ij} = 1$, the right hand side is 0. When $d_{ij} = 0$, the right hand side is M. In both cases, the inequality holds, so $d_{ij}$ could be 0 or 1.\n",

Therefore, when we set the constraint $ 1 \\le 1(1-d_{ij}) $, we force $d_{ij}$ to be zero whenever j is greater than k. As a result, this formula captures the logical constraint in our problem."

This makes sense because the objective function was designed to put as many tasks as early in the week as possible. The reason we are working on Friday at all is because that was the only day that had enough time to complete the entire 354 project in one sitting. Had there been more available work time earlier in the week, this task may have been scheduled on an earlier day. I say it may have been scheduled earlier because we also need to complete all the other tasks on time."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations to the current model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In real life, **we may not know how much time it will take to complete a task.** We could adjust our model to accommodate this by making the durations input a lower bound on projects. In order for the model to be feasible, we would have to provide some sort of upper bound. One such upper bound could be the deadline day minus the start day (in minutes). These new bounds may not be enough to enforce a task duration that's greater than what's provided, but would be the first step in capturing this real-life scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Unlike in this model, **there may be several blocks of available work time per day**. To accommodate this constraint, we could make available work time an array of dictionaries, where the day (or day index is the key) and the value is an array of integers capturing the number of minutes for each chunk of work time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Contrary to the model's constraints, **many tasks are done in more than one sitting**. We can factor in this complexity by allowing fractions of tasks to be done on a given day. If we create a continuous variable between zero and one that represents the fraction of the task done each day, we can adjust our current constraints so that one hundred percent of the task must be done by the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When scheduling a work day, **breaks happen, whether we want them to or not**. Some of the breaks could be captured by allowing multiple chunks of work time a day, but we also may want to take time to transition between tasks or pause on a current task. We can add in travel times between tasks into the sum of work time for a given work day or chunk of a work day. The way we'd incorporate breaks would depend on the kind of breaks taken. For example, if we allow for fractional task completion in a work session, we could add break time in if more than a certain percentage of a task is completed in a given time block. Similarly, if we want to take a break after a certain amount of time (regardless of which task is worked on), we can divide the total work time into sections and build in breaks accordingly."

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This model assigns tasks to a number of work days based on task deadlines, the amount of time available to work, and task precedence constraints. What the model does not give is an absolute order to complete the tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without an absolute ordering, someone would have to look at a task list for a given day and decide which tasks to complete when, which would require them to review the precedence constraints again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, **the next step for this model would be to solve a related problem given the $d$ table we have as output: Given a list of tasks to do on each day, precedence constraints, and deadlines, in what order should tasks be done in a given day?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**There are two potential approaches to this problem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The traveling salesman problem (TSP) ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In the traveling salesman problem, we are given a list of cities to visit and the distances between them. The goal is to visit each city only once while minimizing the overall distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the traveling salesman problem to solve our problem by solving TSP on each day of the week. The cities would be the tasks to do that day. Any precedence constraints could be added into the model. The distance between cities, however, could not be the duration of tasks, since the time needed to complete all tasks would be the same regardless of which order they were done in. One potential distance function could be the travel/transition time between tasks. Once we had a distance function and solved for an ordering for the tasks in each day, we could string those ordered lists together to make one grand to-do list.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I believe this approach could work, one limitation to TSP as a model for this problem is that in TSP, the salesperson returns to the first city they start at. While this doesn't interfere with calculating the order of tasks per se, it complicates the process of putting the list of tasks in order. One way to overcome this limitation is to put a dummy \"First/Last task\" and assign that as the first/last \"city\" in the TSP. "

    "I was surprised by how much work it took to model a planning process I do every week that requires much less mental effort. The work needed to mimic my planning process explains why I haven't seen an app that schedules tasks like these automatically. If we wanted a usable app that did this in the future, we'd need to not only account for the limitations in my model above, but allow it to reschedule and reassign tasks in the event of inevitable interruptions and planning miscalculations. I guess I could just start my homework earlier next time."
